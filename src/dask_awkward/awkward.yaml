  # This option is for cases where new array collections are created
  # with unknown metadata. The default setting is to compute the first
  # partition of the collection so that we can define the metadata. If
  # this option is set to False then collections with unknown metadata
  # will be instantiated with the `_meta` attribute set to an "empty"
  # typetracer, which is an empty awkward array.

  # This option controls whether or not a warning is raised or an
