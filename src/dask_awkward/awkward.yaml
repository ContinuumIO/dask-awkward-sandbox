awkward:

  # This option is for cases where new array collections are created
  # with unknown metadata. The default setting is to compute the first
  # partition of the collection so that we can define the metadata. If
  # this option is set to False then collections with unknown metadata
  # will be instantiated with the `_meta` attribute set to an "empty"
  # typetracer, which is an empty awkward array.

  # Optimization specific configuration
  optimization:

    # This option controls whether or not a warning is thrown, an
    # exception is raised, or if nothing is done a if dask-awkward
    # specific optimization fails (right now this is only the column
    # projection optimization for determining necessary columns). The
    # default value ("warn") will produce a warning if the
    # optimization fails. If this option is set to "raise" and the
    # optimization fails, an exception will be raised intead, crashing
    # a program before an optimized compute. Finally, setting to
    # "pass" the optimization will silently fail and the task graph
    # will not be optimized.
    on-fail: "warn"
